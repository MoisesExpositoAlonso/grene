Accuracy of allele frequencies

sensu Greenblum:

Effective coverage was used as a metric to assess accuracy of all HAFs and non-HAFs.

Effective coverage was calculated by equating the total binomial variance ($BV$) of the true frequencies given an average coverage $C$, where $BV=\sum \frac{pp(1-pp)}{cC}$ to the sum of the squared error (SSE) of estimated allele frequencies $SSE=\sum \sqrt \frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}$. 

$$\sum \frac{p \rho(1-pp)}{cC} = SSE$$
$$C= \frac{\sum p\rho(1-p)}{SSE} $$
